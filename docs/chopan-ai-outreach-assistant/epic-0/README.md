# Epic 0 – Program Foundations

Epic 0 covers the cross-cutting groundwork needed before service implementation. It is split
into two workstreams:

1. **Program Governance & Sandboxing** – establishes the collaboration rules, review gates,
   and sandbox infrastructure used across epics.
2. **Developer Experience & Tooling** – equips contributors with consistent workflows,
   automation, and templates for high-quality delivery.

This folder contains the task tracker and implementation notes for these workstreams.
